# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
## Project Description
A Python EDA Project which analysis about sales generated from which type of customers, from which region, which products they buy, what age groups they belong to and many more

## Outline of the Problem
- The task at hand is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Diwali sales data provided by a company. 
- The analysis should aim to identify ways to increase revenue and improve customer experience. 
- The results of the analysis should be presented in the form of easy-to-understand charts and graphs to provide important insights into the sales model.

## Analysis Framework
- Data Gathering: Collected the releveant diwali sales dataset from kaggle
- Data cleaning and preparation: The data was rectified and assessed in Python to ensure its accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, removing nulls, and verifying the information against other sources.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Used Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain valuable insights on the sales across zones,states, sales by products, sales by customer age group and many more

## Understanding the dataset
- The dataset contains 11251 rows and 15 columns which are shown in the image below:

## Visualizations
- The following visualizations were successfully created using Python Libraries(Seaborn, Matplotlib):

## Lessons Learned

- Always plan ahead: Planning ahead and creating a roadmap of the different activities that need to be completed can help keep the project on track and ensure that all the necessary steps are completed in a timely and efficient manner.

- Data cleaning is essential: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis is a critical step in any data project, as it ensures that the insights are based on accurate and reliable data.

- The importance of visualization: Creating visualizations of the data can help communicate insights to stakeholders and make them more engaging and understandable.

- The power of automation: Using tools and scripts to automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks can save a significant amount of time and effort, allowing more focus on the actual analysis and insights.

- Continuous learning: Technology and tools are constantly evolving, and keeping up to date with the latest developments can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future projects.
